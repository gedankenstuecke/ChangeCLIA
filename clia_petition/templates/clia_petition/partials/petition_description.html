    <h3>Why this matters.</h3>
    <p>
      The Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) supports a
      controversially broad interpretation of the Clinical Laboratory
      Improvement Amendments (CLIA), with a blanket prohibition on
      returning individual data from labs that are not CLIA certified.

    <p>
      <b>As a result, a research participant can consent to sharing their data
      with anyone on earth â€“ except themselves!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This bizarre outcome is legally contested. Others have described
      interpretations that do not result in a wholesale prohibition
      on return of data.
